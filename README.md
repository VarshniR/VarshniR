## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  Iâ€™m Varshni Ramdhani âœ¨

I am currently working as a Data Governance Analyst at VF Corporation.

I was born and raised in Paramaribo, Suriname (South America).

I graduated in 2016 with a Bachelors in Information and Communication Technology.

Over the years I have build my work experience from working as Assistant Manager, Head of Sales & Distribution, Customer Service Manager & Data Quality Analyst.

I have always been interested in numbers, statistics and I love to see a graph "come to life" when you insert the right data.

I began my career in Data Analytics leveraging Excel to create a single source of truth for a company in my home town. This helped the company grow their sales organization by 15%.

I transferred these skills to becoming the Head of Sales and Distribution for another company where I accelerated their sales by 30% by engaging with customers and optimizing their sales data to understand customer trends.

After helping businesses in my hometown, I moved to New York where I helped a window treatments company improve their efficiency by 20%.

I transitioned to the financial industry where I improved the accuracy of financial documents by 15%, corrected inconsistencies and reduced expenses by 10%.

Iâ€™m looking to continue my career as a Data Analyst and help companies get more value from their data.

Iâ€™m an avid learner, always looking for something new to read or a course to take.
